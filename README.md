# Hotel-Reservation
Our task is to classify a Hotel Reservation as either booking canceled (class1) or no canceled(class0) and use more one model to arrive the best model.


What you will learn before do this project ?

1) Deal with all missing values.
2) Using Encoding and OneHotEncoding to tranform dataset to be numeric.
3) Make scaling to be data in the same range using StandardScaler.
4) Splitting Dataset to tree parts ( Training, Validation and Testing ).
5) Start to set dataset to model.
6) Using almost supervised machine learning model.
7) Example of model use DescionTree, SVC and RandomForest.
8) Start train all model.
9) Calculate the accuracy of train and validation.
10) Choose the best hyperparameter in train and validation.
11) Take the best validataion from all model train.
12) Test the best model.

Before this steps you learn alot know can put you model in real life problem.
